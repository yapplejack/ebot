Some actions CAN be done by the robot but we will not put resources into having those capabilities as they are byproducts of the design we finished with.

The included 6\\" rubber treaded wheels allow for easy traversing across the field and over the cable protector. The center wheel of the AM14U5 is dropped \u215b\u201d lower than the other wheels, this will allow for static friction when turning side to side, thus making it easier to make micro adjustments when picking up or scoring game pieces.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/gearbox-assembly":{"id":"chassis/gearbox-assembly","title":"gearbox-assembly","description":"&nbsp;","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/required-tools-and-first-cuts":{"id":"chassis/required-tools-and-first-cuts","title":"chassis Assembly","description":"Required tools:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/wheel-assembly":{"id":"chassis/wheel-assembly","title":"Wheel assembly","description":"Start assembling the wheels by screwing two pulley halves into one side of each wheel. Each half-pulley (AndyMark part number am-2234a-half) has one raised screw hole and one recessed screw hole on the bottom. Connect two halves together by lining the raised portion of one half with the recessed hole on the other. The ridged portion of the pulley that the belt will actually ride on should line up across the two pulleys with no gaps or misaligned teeth. The pulley is then screwed into the matching hole pattern on one side of the 6\\" HiGrip wheel (am-0940b) using six 10-12 1.25\u201d screws (am-1592). Tighten these bolts in a star pattern like you would when changing a tire on a car to ensure the pulley is aligned evenly on the wheel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
