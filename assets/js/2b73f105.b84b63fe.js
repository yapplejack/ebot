The drivetrain is the sum of all components that allow a robot to move along the ground. In our case this robot has something called a differential drive. Robots with differential drives move forward and backwards as you would expect by spinning the wheels forwards or backwards at the same speed. Turning is less straightforward and there are different ways to turn depending on the situation. To change the direction the robot is facing you can turn the wheels in opposite directions. This maneuver will keep the robot in place but that might be undesirable in some situations. Instead you can power a single wheel, this will turn the robot using the unpowered wheel as a pivot point. Finally the robot can make slower turns while moving forwards by powering both wheels in the same direction but underpowering the side you want to turn towards."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Now that you know the basics of the differential drivetrain\u2019s movements let's talk about controlling it.

You already have some experience with this style if you drove the robot around during the setup. Arcade drive works by using a left-right X-axis and an up-down Y-axis. These axes can be on the same stick or on different sticks. Moving the Y-axis up will move the robot forward and down will move the robot backwards. Combining them by pushing the control stick on a diagonal will work as expected, pushing 80% up and 20% left will power both wheels forwards and underpower the left side by 20%, thus turning to the left. The right wheel will have 80% power and the left will have 60%. Reversing the situation; pushing 20% up and 80% left will power the right side of the drivetrain at 80% and the left motor at -60% percent, thus turning significantly more heavily but still moving \u201cforwards\u201d."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The other main style is Tank Drive.
