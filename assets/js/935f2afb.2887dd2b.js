The included 6\\" rubber treaded wheels allow for easy traversing across the field and over the cable protector. The center wheel of the AM14U5 is dropped \u215b\u201d lower than the other wheels, this will allow for static friction when turning side to side, thus making it easier to make micro adjustments when picking up or scoring game pieces.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/gearbox-assembly":{"id":"chassis/gearbox-assembly","title":"Motor and gearbox assembly","description":"For each of your four drivetrain motors, place two 5/16&rdquo; washers (am-1009a) onto the shaft. If your team is a rookie team, your kit of parts should include four CIM motors. If you are not a rookie, your kit will contain only two CIM motors, so you will need to purchase two new motors or reuse two from a previous year (recommended). If you already own more than four NEO motors, consider using them in your drivetrain instead of CIMs. One NEO motor will be used elsewhere on the Everybot, so if you only have four NEOs do not use them on your drivetrain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/required-tools-and-first-cuts":{"id":"chassis/required-tools-and-first-cuts","title":"Requied Tools/parts and the first cuts","description":"Required tools:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chassis/wheel-assembly":{"id":"chassis/wheel-assembly","title":"Wheel Assembly","description":"Start assembling the wheels by screwing two pulley halves into one side of each wheel. Each half-pulley (AndyMark part number am-2234a-half) has one raised screw hole and one recessed screw hole on the bottom. Connect two halves together by lining the raised portion of one half with the recessed hole on the other. The ridged portion of the pulley that the belt will actually ride on should line up across the two pulleys with no gaps or misaligned teeth. The pulley is then screwed into the matching hole pattern on one side of the 6&rdquo; HiGrip wheel (am-0940b) using six 10-12 1.25&rdquo; screws (am-1592). Tighten these bolts in a star pattern like you would when changing a tire on a car to ensure the pulley is aligned evenly on the wheel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"superstructure/assembly":{"id":"superstructure/assembly","title":"Superstructure Assembly","description":"Tools required:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"superstructure/gearbox":{"id":"superstructure/gearbox","title":"MAX Planetary gearbox assembly","description":"Tools required:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"superstructure/machining":{"id":"superstructure/machining","title":"Superstructure Machining","description":"Start by cutting all tube stock and hex shaft listed as part of the Superstructure in the cut list.
