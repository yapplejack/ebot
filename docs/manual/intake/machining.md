The plastic panel needs to be cut to 18&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo;. One set of these holes could be drilled ahead of time but we will hold off until later.

The intake has two sides, each with a different combination of pulleys and gears on the different intake rollers and shafts. For best functionality and reliability it is ideal if these components are lined up nicely and cannot disengage with each other. To help keep everything lined up, a few PVC spacers are used:

<p><br /> </p>

<ul><li>Qty(2) 0.8&rdquo; sections to cover some sections of bare hex shaft</li><li>Qty(2) spacers used to keep the 36 tooth gears in line. The thickness of these spacers depends on the exact gears you are using. The spacers should be 0.8&rdquo; - [the thickness of your 36T gears].</li><li>Qty(3) spacers used to keep the 24 tooth pulleys in line. The thickness of these spacers depends on the exact pulleys you are using. The spacers should be 0.8&rdquo; - [the thickness of your 24T pulleys].</li></ul>

Finally cut all hex shafts used for the intake to length using the cutlist and tap them to 10-32. If you wish to avoid making the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#ea9999"}}>04_Intake_Cluster_Shaft</span>&nbsp;you can instead use the leftover hex outshaft included with the REV Maxplanetary gearbox with a shaft collar to retain the pulley.
