# 4 Bar Linkage Springs

Once the arm has been turned, the latex surgical tubing will be retensioned to assist in keeping the arm in position better. The Everybot uses surgical tubing or other springs to make the arm capable of holding itself both fully extended <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline"}}>and</span>&nbsp;fully retracted. It does this by taking advantage of a quirk of geometry that creates two locations where the same spring pulls the mechanism towards the each end of travel.

In the above image, the springs (represented by the purple arrow) are pulling the two yellow points at either end towards each other, pulling the lower linkage up, driving the mechanism out and forwards.

When the arm is stowed, the same spring pulls the driven linkage backwards and up, pulling the arm in and down towards the stowed configuration.

Because this spring acts opposite to gravity, the two effects combine to make the mechanism largely stable in any position. Combined with the force needed to backdrive the gearbox that drives the arm, the intake should stay in position without needing to power the arm motor.

Untie the tubing added earlier and adjust how taut it is until it is just tight enough that they successfully hold the arm up in its fully deployed position while still allowing the motor to overpower them to drive the arm in and out. We found that a length of about 18&rdquo; to 19&rdquo; may be enough to constrain the arm.

Tuning is not a one and done activity. As you practice you will continue to tune it to work best with your field elements. You may also need to devise a system for keeping your turnbuckles in place after tuning them while still keeping them easy to adjust in the future. After arriving at a competition and before your first match, try to participate in practice matches to see how the robot needs to be adjusted for the particular field at the event. Some events also have a specific &ldquo;field calibration&rdquo; period specifically for adjusting mechanisms like this - ask a referee or FTA at your event for more details.
