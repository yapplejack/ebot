# Arm Adjustments

If the intake is close to the proper height when fully extended and hitting the hard stop but the stowed position hardstop is too far away to prevent the intake from hitting the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ead3"}}>02_Superstructure_Mid_Crossbeam</span>, try flipping the direction of the U-bolts on the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ead3"}}>02_Superstructure_Supports</span>. Untie the rope from the hardstop turnbuckle, make sure the turnbuckle is about half open, and find the new position to retie it when the arm is in the collecting position using the method described previously. 

<p><br /> </p>

If this does not fix the stowing issue the U-bolts can also be moved on the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ead3"}}>02_Superstructure_Support</span>. This can be done if the height of the intake is fairly close to the desired location when the arm is in the collecting position. If the collecting and scoring height is off it will be best to wait until later to reposition the U-bolts.

Now that we have all adjustment mechanisms in place we will double check that we have the valid starting lengths and then adjust for the ideal geometry.

First, double check to make sure that the center to center Piano Hinge distance on the secondary linkage of the 4 bar mechanism is as close to 23&rdquo; as you can. This will allow the arm to swing along the desired arc.

Now focus on using the adjustable turnbuckle on the arm hardstop to limit how far out the arm is able to move. The front roller should be at 50.75&rdquo; off the ground, and 39.75&rdquo; away from the front of the drivebase. 

The primary goal in these adjustments is to ensure that as the robot approaches an upright cone on the loading zone platform, <span style={{ fontWeight: "700"}}>the outermost roller contacts the very tip of the cone first</span>&nbsp;and sucks it into the middle roller, pulling the cone&nbsp;up and into the mechanism.

<p><br /> <br /> </p>

Let&#39;s take a look at how adjusting these linkages impacts the position and movement of the front roller.

Shortening the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#f6b26b"}}>03_Arm_Tension_Unit</span>&nbsp;using the turnbuckle on the steel cable, shown via the first orange arrow, will cause the first roller to move further up and in due to the long lever arm that the <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ead3"}}>03_Arm_Main_Link</span>&nbsp;and the intake itself form. Conversely, lengthening this linkage will result in the first roller dropping and swinging in a wider arc. In both cases, the roller will move along a circular path like shown in purple above as the intake pivots about the rear linkage pin.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '617.68px', height: '460.10px'}}><img src={require("/static/media/finishing/image_28.png").default} style={{ width: '617.68px', height: '460.10px', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></img></span></div></div>

Shortening the primary hardstop will cause the roller to stop sooner in its movement. As pictured, shortening the primary hardstop will cause the front roller to move down and backwards slightly. It is our suggestion to use this as your primary tool to change the position of the intake rollers, as changing the length of the linkage changes the shape of the whole mechanism&#39;s movement. It is significantly more important to hit the correct roller height if you are having trouble hitting both.

If done correctly, the robot should be able to pick from the loading zone, and score in the high levels, for both cubes and cones, with the arm fully outstretched. If the distance from the robot is off you may have trouble scoring cones. If you find that the cone you are trying to score is hitting the cone node in the middle row before reaching the high row, the arm should be tuned for further outwards reach by loosening the hard stop turnbuckle or otherwise lengthening the reach of the arm. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the stowing position as the robot is required to start inside its frame at the beginning of the match. The U-bolts on <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#d9ead3"}}>02_Superstructure_Supports</span>&nbsp;may need to be flipped or moved if the correct arm geometry has been achieved but the robot does not stow.
