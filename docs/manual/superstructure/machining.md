# Superstructure Machining

Start by cutting all tube stock and hex shaft listed as part of the Superstructure in the cut list. Their names all begin with &ldquo;02_Superstructure.&rdquo; The first piece to be machined further are the&nbsp;02_Superstructure_Uprights.

Many of the holes pictured do not have a dimension. These holes are for attaching gussets whose hole spacing may be different between manufacturers. It is easier to drill many of these holes with the exact gussets you are using clamped in place.

<br /> 

The holes in the upright can be made in one of two ways. They could simply be dimensioned out using calipers to mark the offset from the side rail and bottom, then center punched and drilled out. Alternatively, they can be placed in the chassis, clamped down, and drilled out. The 02_Superstructure_Uprights are not meant to be flush to the chassis back plate, there is a 1/8&rdquo; gap between them. To fix that, put a piece of chassis cutoff between the back of the chassis and the 02_Superstructure_Upright. Then clamp the 02_Superstructure_Upright&nbsp;in place, use a speed square to make sure the upright is perpendicular to the frame, and drill out the 1/4&rdquo; hole. Pictures of this method are shown below. These holes are drilled all the way through 02_Superstructure_Upright.

You could choose to drill the 1/2&rdquo; access holes now but we choose to do it later. If you do not drill the access hole, it may be best to mirror the two 02_Superstructure_Uprights as they are in the picture below and mark them left and right (they will be left and right sides when viewing the robot from the back). If you do drill the access hole now you will need to make sure that the smaller holes face the outside of the robot.

At first glance this part looks very challenging but becomes significantly easier to manage when using some of the other Everybot components. Once again a good chunk of these holes can be ignored as they may be different depending on the gussets used.

<br /> 

You will be making two of these 02_Superstructure_Mainbeams. The main focus is the following: the 1.125&rdquo; bearing holes need to line up nicely as there will be a long hex shaft running between them and the holes must be as straight as possible. To help with the holes lining up it may be best to clamp these pieces of tube stock together on their 2&rdquo; faces. Make sure to use plenty of camps, we want to avoid the tube stock shifting during drilling at all costs.

<br /> 

After clamping the tube stock together, start by scribing the location of the lowest 1.125&rdquo; hole on one of the pieces of tube stock (it is surrounded by the four smaller holes). It is 1&rdquo; from the side and 5.4&rdquo; from the bottom. Use calipers to scribe a locating cross at that location to mark the center of the hole.

Locate one of the Thrifty Bearing Megaplates. Looking at the image below, locate the edge marked in red of the Bearing Megaplate 4.425&rdquo; up from the bottom of the 02_Superstructure_Mainbeams and&nbsp;clamp the Bearing Megaplate in the orientation shown, making sure to double check the plate is at the correct distance. Then drill out the four holes in the 2&rdquo; circle around the bearing hole all the way through the box tube with a #7 drill bit. Two of these holes are already this size on the Bearing Megaplate, the other two holes are smaller than the #7 drill bit and will be drilled out in both the Bearing Megaplate and the tube stock. Using a drill press is highly recommended to make these holes as straight as possible.

Drill out a pilot hole with the #7 bit at the cross marked at the center of the bearing hole. This will be widened out to 1.125&rdquo; with a step bit later.

<p><br /> </p>

After the holes have been drilled the Bearing Megaplate can be removed and the top 1.125&rdquo; bearing hole can be drilled through with a #7 pilot hole. The upper 1.125&rdquo; hole is offset 0.94&rdquo; and 1.06&rdquo; from each side of the tube stock instead of being perfectly centered across the 2&rdquo; face.

<span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  float: 'right', width: '279.81px', height: '430.09px'}}><img src={require("/static/media/superstructure/machining/image_5.png").default} style={{ width: '279.81px', height: '430.09px', marginLeft: '0px', marginTop: '0px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></img> </span>

After drilling out all holes the two pieces of tube stock can be separated. The next step will be to cut the 50 degree angle. Instead of trying to mark the angle itself, mark the ending height of the cut at 2.38&rdquo; up from the bottom corner and then use a straight edge to connect that mark to the other corner. The tube stock should remain long on the side that the 0.94&rdquo; upper bearing hole offset measurement was taken from. Cut along this line on a vertical bandsaw or chopsaw.

<p><br /> </p>

Finally, use a step drill bit to widen the two bearing holes. The lower bearing hole should be drilled out to 1.125&rdquo; but it may be slightly beneficial to oversize the hole as the Bearing Megaplate will do all the work when retaining this bearing. The uppermost hole is dimensioned to 1.125&rdquo; and the bearing may be able to fall in if it is oversized, as this hole does help to retain a bearing. The hole only needs to be large enough to fit a 1/2&rdquo; hex shaft, so a 7/8&rdquo; hole would be plenty big enough without worrying about your bearings falling inside the box tube.

Once those holes are drilled out you will have completed the machining for the hardest piece of tube stock on the robot!

The 02_Superstructure_Support&nbsp;is extremely straightforward compared to the previous two pieces of tube stock. Use calipers to scribe the first hole and make a thru hole using a 1/4&rdquo; drill bit. The top angle can be cut the same way as before, scribe a mark 0.58&rdquo; down the edge and use a straightedge to draw a line to the corner to cut across.
