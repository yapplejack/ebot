# Superstructure Overview

The Superstructure is made up of six main machined pieces of tube stock with a number of cut to length crossbeams for support. The basic assembly steps are:

1. Cut all tube stock and hex shaft to proper length. The cuts marked as for the Superstructure in the [cut list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_pTHQV9YwcAtf3_clEg5P17Wjkwd5Gorz2NcEoRKRs/edit?usp=sharing) will be used.

2. Drill out the chassis attachment holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.

3. Bolt some smaller components to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam to help correctly locate several of the holes. Cut the angle into the bottom corner.

4. Drill out the chassis attachment holes in 02_Superstructure_Support and add the angle.

5. Gusset and rivet 02_Superstructure_Upright to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam.

6. Add crossbeams between the two sides of the superstructure.

7. Mount the superstructure to the chassis.

8. Correctly position the 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam and rivet the 02_Superstructure_Support to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam to hold it in place.

9. Add the battery bracket and additional crossbracing.

10. Assemble the MAX Planetary gearbox and insert the 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft through the gearbox and lower bearing holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.

11. Add Clamping Bearing Blocks to the upper bearing holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.
