# What To Buy When Starting Off

    Idea for the video:

        I would like for this video to briefly go over all tools required to build an Everybot. The video would not be a tutorial for the tools, instead they should be quickly described, showcased and possibly given a few purchasing notes. <br /> <br />
        This video should be incredibly useful for teams who may not have shop experience. Right now I think a good amount of teams rely on <a href='https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/frc_tool_recommendations.pdf'>this</a> which is a decent start but a tad overwhelming, especially if a lot of these tools are foreign. You can describe the utility of a drill press and show a picture of it but I believe it will click best for people when they see it in action. <br /> <br />
        It would be cool if the video was laid out so that each demo helps complete parts on a previous year's Everybot. For instance various cutting machines, tape measure, calipers, center punch, clamps, drill, drill press, and step drill bits could all be chained together on the same part roughly in that order.

We can either create our own list with my more pictures or build off of the official FIRST list provided by [Spectrum](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/frc_tool_recommendations.pdf). Their list is pretty decent, missing only a few keys tools (calipers and a few others) and recommending a few items that are not applicable to our BOMs (like Anderson Crimping Tools).

Not sure which direction is the best and the video could be enough but I have seen some unfortunate purchases with the current list. For instance they do not specify a bladed cutoff wheel for their chop saw, I have seen some teams purchase abrasive chop saws. The team I worked with this year had bought one and it cost us a ton of time and accuracy.
