# Resource Collection

[REV robot basics](https://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/FRC-Robot-Basics-Guide.pdf) It has great stuff like bolting through tube, riveting and working with chain with the rest focused on understanding of commonly used REV products.

<br/><br/>

[VEXpro match drilling](https://content.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/pdf/217-8000-MDG.pdf) Probably something not to include and to use inspiration for but good info.

<br/><br/>

[How Do I Use Gussets by AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_3W9ELyjOo) This is close to being useful but is for FTC, doesn't cover riveting gussets, drilling holes for gussets, clamping to get them in, etc.

<br/><br/>

[How Do I Use Calipers by AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clHuB5NZ2Pk) Another video that is close but doesn't cover marking dimensions, it is purely about taking measurements. Therefore not really relevant to our team's use case.

<br/><br/>

[How Do I Press A Pinion by AM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAH_QNMDPFQ) This is great but I personally would probably add some jank that can be done if you don't have an arbor press, as a good chunk of Everybot teams won't. Obviously we tell them to buy one but if it late in the season, they are out of money, etc. it would be good to inform them of additional ways to press pinions and the dangers of them.

[Pressing a Pinion on a NEO 550 by REV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUGuVDLZlI) Great video, doesn't need the outro is has and again I wish it included some jank, you can 100% press NEO 550 pinions with a clamp in a pinch, my team did this for all of ours including our swerve and had zero issues (this was not recommended in the discord, manual or build videos). Again we should have 100% had a arbor press but it is significantly better than hammering them or other some other solutions teams could use. Also it has 4.6k views, which is a lot, there is a market for these kinds of videos. 

[Drill Press Safety Video and Tutorial - FRC 4153](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skLueD5ZWAg) This video is fire, has a ton of info really quickly, the best video from an FRC team on drill presses that I was able to find. Personally I would like to pair teaching the drill press with a machine drawing covering a few different scenarios like through holes, match drilling and stepper bits. Basically the 3 common things you can expect to do on an Everybot.
