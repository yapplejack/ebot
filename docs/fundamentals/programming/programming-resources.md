# Programming Resources

TODO: find good resources for coding, I expect to add the intro to java course from code academy, need to know about Python

The best place to start your FRC coding journey no matter your skill level is the [WPILib documentation website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html). It is "the official documentation home for the FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition Control System and WPILib software packages". Their Zero to Robot section will get you a driving robot without knowledge of programming. Beyond that there are hardware and software component overviews, programming basics, advanced programming, example projects and so much more.

Another incredibly important resource from WPILib is their source code for [Java](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibj/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj) and [C++](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibc/src/main/native/cpp) or their more concise documentation for [Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/) and [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/). This is incredibly useful for understanding what specific pieces of code do, for instance here is the source code for the [differential drive class](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/main/wpilibj/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.java) which can be used to drive your robot.
