    * Some components will remain unused

Begin by assembling the MAX Planetary 90 Degree Gearbox. Place the two Side Plates down so that the recessed counterbores around some of the mounting holes are on the bottom. Insert two of the flanged bearings so the flanges are on the flat side of the Side Plates.

Install the two Standoffs into the two holes closest to the angled corners in the flat side of one of the Side Plates with two 10-32 3/8" button head screws. Insert the Output Shaft into the bearing in the SIde Plate with Standoffs installed. The end of the Output Shaft with the short hexagonal section should be facing upwards and away from the Side Plate.

Take the Bottom Plate with raised corners facing up and insert one of the flanged bearings down into it. Press the Input Gear into the bearing so the slanted teeth are facing up.

Set down the Middle Plate so that the recessed counterbore for the bearing is facing up and insert the small bearing into the Middle Plate.

Pick up the Middle Plate with bearing and flip it over, interesting it down on top of the Input gear. The Middle Plate will float above the Bottom Plate.

Turn the assembly on its side and set it into the Side Plate so that the Middle Plate slots into the notches in the Side Plate and the edge of the Bottom Plate sits flush with the Side Plate.

Slide the Bevel Gear down onto the end of the Output Shaft so that its hexagonal center hole mates with the hexagonal section of the Output Shaft and the slanted teeth of the gear mate with the slanted teeth of the Input Gear.

Drop the second Side Plate and bearing down on top of the assembly so the recessed screw holes are facing upwards. Install four 10-32 3/8" button head screws in the recessed holes in the Side Plate and into both the Standoffs and the Bottom Plate. Leave these bolts slightly loose for now.

Flip the gearbox over and install the last two 10-32 3/8" button head screws through the Side Plate and into the Bottom Plate. Leave these screws slightly loose. Check that the gearbox spins smoothly by spinning it by hand and that all the plates are pressed flush against each other.

After checking that the gearbox spins smoothly, tighten all the 10-32 3/8" screws. Make sure the gearbox still turns smoothly. Insert the MAX Planetary Spline to 1/2” Hex Adaptor into the input of the 90 Degree Gearbox.

Take the MAX Planetary 3:1 Stage and line it up with the spline sticking out of the 90 Degree Gearbox. Rotate the gear cartridge until the two splines line up and mesh together. Continue rotating the cartridge until all the mounting and alignment features are engaged and the cartridge sits flush against the gearbox.

Take the two MAX Planetary 5:1 Stage cartridges and add them both to the stackup one at a time, making sure the splines and alignment features mesh together properly and there are no gaps in the stack.

Now prepare the NEO motor to be installed into the stackup. Place the MAX Planetary Universal Input Stage against the face of the NEO motor and align the two mounting holes with the mounting holes in the face of the NEO motor. Screw the NEO motor in place using two 10-32 1/2" socket cap bolts. Spin both bolts down into place and then alternate back and forth between the two bolts to evenly tighten them. 

Take the 2mm machine key in the MAX Planetary Input Coupler Kit and insert it into the keyway of the NEO motor as close to the face of the NEO motor as possible. Align the keyway in the Input Coupler with the machine key and slide it over the NEO’s output shaft and key.

Align the stacked gear stages with the Input Stage and the Input Coupler. You may have to rotate the bottom 5:1 gear cartridge to get the Input Coupler to mesh properly. Make sure there are no gaps between the Input Stage and the individual gear cartridges, rotating them slightly until their alignment features fall into place.

Bolt the stack together using two 10-32 3" Socket Head screws, the longest that come provided in the MAX Planetary Base Kit. The bolts are inserted into the holes next to the NEO motor in the Input Plate, through the gear cartridges, and into the 90 Degree Gearbox.

Fit a 1/2" hex bearing into one of the Thrifty Bearing Megaplates and position it on the rear left 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam so that the mounting holes around the bearing line up with the holes drilled in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. Line up the mounting holes in the output face of the MAX Planetary gearbox and bolt through the Thrifty Bearing Megaplate and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and into the MAX Planetary gearbox with four 10-32 1-1/2 button head bolts. The two smaller number 8 sized holes in the Thrifty Bearing Megaplate should have already been drilled out to fit a 10-32 bolt with a #7 drill bit when the Bearing Megalate was used in constructing the 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam.

Similarly affix the other Thrifty Bearing Megaplate with smaller holes drilled out to the rear right 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam with four more 10-32 1-1/2 button head bolts and 10-32 locknuts on the other side. Insert a hex bearing from the outside, which will be held in by a washer and bolt later.

02_Superstructure_Jackshaft can be slid through the bearings and gearbox at this time. If your hex shaft is not easily going through the bearings and gearbox, the bolts holding them tight on the bar can be slightly loosened and retightened in a slightly different position in their hole or a rubber mallet can be used to knock 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft into place. There should be room for a 24 Tooth 1/2" Hex Sprocket on either end of the shaft. Use a 10-32 3/8” bolt and a washer to retain the 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft.

(ignore the extra bearing located on the inside face of the right 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam - this was a slightly earlier design)

The two Thrifty Clamping Bearing Blocks are installed around the upper 1.125" inch holes in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beams. Insert a flanged 1/2” hex bearing into each half so that the flange sits inside the ridge on the inside of each half. The bearing will stick out the front of the block - if it sticks out in the same direction as the mounting posts in the corners, flip it around.

The bearing blocks have a "top" and a “bottom.” If you place them down on a table you can see that there are two different orientations - the position on the left, with the longer section facing up, has the bearing hole lower down on the plate than with the short side up like on the right. The long side of the bearing block should face upward on 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. This is why the upper bearing holes were slightly offset from center when drilling 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam earlier.

Hold each half of the bearing blocks against the upper bearing hole in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and use the provided bolts to hold the two halves together. Rivet the blocks in place in the hole pointing down 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam with a 3/16 rivet to prevent them from moving on the beam. Only rivet this hole, as any other rivets in this plate will rub against the chain later on.

Lastly, we will add some additional reinforcement to the top crossbeam using chassis cutoff. To manufacture this part cutoff the shorter piece of the "C". Then cut down the inner part of the C such that it fits onto the 1x1 02_Superstructure_Top_Crossbeam. The hole locations do not matter too much. Attached like shown in the photo below. Do this on both sides of the 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam.
