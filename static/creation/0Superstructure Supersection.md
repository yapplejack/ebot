# Superstructure Overview

**Superstructure**** Architecture:**

The Superstructure is made up of six main machined pieces of tube stock with a number of cut to length crossbeams for support. The basic assembly steps are:

1. Cut all tube stock and hex shaft to proper length. The cuts marked as for the Superstructure in the [cut list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_pTHQV9YwcAtf3_clEg5P17Wjkwd5Gorz2NcEoRKRs/edit?usp=sharing) will be used.

2. Drill out the chassis attachment holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.

3. Bolt some smaller components to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam to help correctly locate several of the holes. Cut the angle into the bottom corner.

4. Drill out the chassis attachment holes in 02_Superstructure_Support and add the angle.

5. Gusset and rivet 02_Superstructure_Upright to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam.

6. Add crossbeams between the two sides of the superstructure.

7. Mount the superstructure to the chassis.

8. Correctly position the 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam and rivet the 02_Superstructure_Support to 02_Superstructure_Mainbeam to hold it in place.

9. Add the battery bracket and additional crossbracing.

10. Assemble the MAX Planetary gearbox and insert the 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft through the gearbox and lower bearing holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.

11. Add Clamping Bearing Blocks to the upper bearing holes in 02_Superstructure_Upright.

If at any point you are unsure of what a direction or diagram is telling you to do, please ask for clarification in the Everybot [Discord](https://discord.gg/XuWfwRJcfA)! This is the fastest way to get an answer from the Everybot team, and questions we see there will help us to revise this manual to make steps more clear for other Everybot builders.

# Superstructure Machining

Start by cutting all tube stock and hex shaft listed as part of the Superstructure in the cut list. Their names all begin with "02_Superstructure." The first piece to be machined further are the 02_Superstructure_Uprights.

Many of the holes pictured do not have a dimension. These holes are for attaching gussets whose hole spacing may be different between manufacturers. It is easier to drill many of these holes with the exact gussets you are using clamped in place.

The holes in the upright can be made in one of two ways. They could simply be dimensioned out using calipers to mark the offset from the side rail and bottom, then center punched and drilled out. Alternatively, they can be placed in the chassis, clamped down, and drilled out. The 02_Superstructure_Uprights are not meant to be flush to the chassis back plate, there is a 1/8" gap between them. To fix that, put a piece of chassis cutoff between the back of the chassis and the 02_Superstructure_Upright. Then clamp the 02_Superstructure_Upright in place, use a speed square to make sure the upright is perpendicular to the frame, and drill out the 1/4” hole. Pictures of this method are shown below. These holes are drilled all the way through 02_Superstructure_Upright.

You could choose to drill out the mirrored 1/2" access holes now but we choose to do it later when the superstructure was already partially assembled, making it more obvious which holes needed to be drilled out.

At first glance this part looks very challenging but becomes significantly easier to manage when using some of the other Everybot components. Once again a good chunk of these holes can be ignored as they may be different depending on the gussets used.

You will be making two of these 02_Superstructure_Mainbeams. The main focus is the following: the 1.125" bearing holes need to line up nicely as there will be a long hex shaft running between them and the holes must be as straight as possible. To help with the holes lining up it may be best to clamp these pieces of tube stock together on their 2” faces. Make sure to use plenty of camps, we want to avoid the tube stock shifting during drilling at all costs.

After clamping the tube stock together, start by scribing the location of the lowest 1.125" hole on one of the pieces of tube stock (it is surrounded by the four smaller holes). It is 1” from either side and 5.4” from the bottom. Use calipers to scribe a locating cross at that location to mark the center of the hole and a punch to leave an indentation to drill in later.

Locate one of the Thrifty Bearing Megaplates. Looking at the image below, locate the edge marked in red of the Bearing Megaplate 4.425" up from the bottom of the 02_Superstructure_Mainbeams and clamp the Bearing Megaplate in the orientation shown, making sure to double check the plate is at the correct distance. Then drill out the four holes in the 2” circle around the bearing hole all the way through the box tube with a #7 drill bit. Two of these holes are already this size on the Bearing Megaplate, the other two holes are smaller than the #7 drill bit and will be drilled out in both the Bearing Megaplate and the tube stock. Using a drill press is highly recommended to make these holes as straight as possible.

Drill out a pilot hole with the #7 bit at the cross marked at the center of the bearing hole. This will be widened out to 1.125" with a step bit later.

After the holes have been drilled the Bearing Megaplate can be removed and the top 1.125" bearing hole can be drilled through with a #7 pilot hole. The upper 1.125” hole is offset 0.94” and 1.06” from each side of the tube stock instead of being perfectly centered across the 2” face.

After drilling out all holes the two pieces of tube stock can be separated. The next step will be to cut the 50 degree angle. Instead of trying to mark the angle itself, mark the ending height of the cut at 2.38" up from the bottom corner and then use a straight edge to connect that mark to the other corner. The tube stock should remain long on the side that the 0.94” upper bearing hole offset measurement was taken from. Cut along this line on a vertical bandsaw or chopsaw.

Finally, use a step drill bit to widen the two bearing holes. The lower bearing hole should be drilled out to 1.125" but it may be slightly beneficial to oversize the hole as the Bearing Megaplate will do all the work when retaining this bearing. The uppermost hole is dimensioned to 1.125” and the bearing may be able to fall in if it is oversized, as this hole does help to retain a bearing. The hole only needs to be large enough to fit a 1/2” hex shaft through it, so a 7/8” hole would be plenty big enough without worrying about your bearings falling inside the box tube.

Once those holes are drilled out you will have completed the machining for the hardest piece of tube stock on the robot!

The 02_Superstructure_Support is extremely straightforward compared to the previous two pieces of tube stock. Use calipers to scribe the first hole and make a thru hole using a 1/4" drill bit. The top angle can be cut the same way as before, scribe a mark 0.58” down the edge and use a straightedge to draw a line to the corner to cut across.

To make assembly easier for you than it was for us, take one of the Side Plates from the REV 90 Degree Gearbox and two of the Thrifty Bearing Megaplates. Take four 10-32 1-1/2" bolts and two 10-32 locknuts. Line a Bearing Megaplate up with the lower bearing hole of one of your 02_Superstructure_Main_Beams and put two of the bolts through the larger holes in the Bearing Megaplate, through the box tube, and into the REV 90 degree gearbox in the orientation shown in the picture on the right. Then do the same for the other 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam except the bolts will have locknuts on the ends instead of the Side Plate from the REV 90 Degree Gearbox. We want to attach these plates so we do not accidentally rivet gussets over the desired locations. 

Some of the pictures below will not show these components attached, but we found this method made assembly easier and prevented gussets from being attached in places that would foul up later assemblies.

Place  02_Superstructure_Upright and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam together so that the angled edge of 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam lines up against the top of 02_Superstructure_Upright. The angled edge of 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam should be up against and be covered by the one inch wide face of 02_Superstructure_Upright, while both ends of 02_Superstructure_Upright should be uncovered. The two holes at the bottom of 02_Superstructure_Upright should be further away from 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and closer to the back of the structure. These two assemblies will become the sides of the main superstructure of the Everybot.

Clamp a 120 Degree Gusset into place at the top of the join between 02_Superstructure_Upright and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and rivet the assembly together by drilling through the gusset holes with a #7 bit and riveting the gussets to each piece of box tube with 3/16 rivets. For now, you may want to only rivet every other hole in each gusset until you know the geometry of your superstructure works out just in case you need to drill them out to change or fix a piece. The attached Bearing Megaplate and 90 Degree Gearbox Side Plate will prevent you from positioning whichever gussets you are using over where they will need to be mounted permanently later. Note, if the gusset sticks out off the end you may want to mark and cut it to be flush with the end of the 2x1. 

Add an additional 150 Degree Gusset to the inside corner of the join between 02_Superstructure_Upright and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and similarly rivet it into place. This assembly (and future gusseted assemblies) may look slightly different depending on which brand of gussets you are using.

Flip the assembly over and rivet another 150 Degree Gusset and 120 Degree Gusset to the other side in the same orientations. Repeat this assembly with the other 02_Superstructure_Upright and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam.

To connect the two sides of the arm superstructure, clamp two 90 Degree Gussets at the top of 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam so that they face inwards and line up with the top face of 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. Clamp the long side of two T Gussets onto 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam so the protruding tab faces inwards. The center of the protrusion should be located 4.5 inches from where 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam meets 02_Superstructure_Upright. Make sure it does not encroach on where the 90 Degree Gearbox will be based on where the Side Plate is currently mounted.

The 02_Superstructure_Top_Crossbeam should be clamped between the two side assemblies and onto the two 90 Degree Gussets and drilled and riveted into place using a number 7 drill bit and 3/16 rivets. 02_Superstructure_Mid_Crossbeam is similarly clamped and riveted between the 02_Superstructure_Main_Beams to the two T Gussets. If you drill out a few holes at first and place rivets into them, they will hold the work pieces in place so you can drill the rest of the holes. 

Now that the arm superstructure has an inside and an outside, drill out the four inner holes at the bottom of each 02_Superstructure_Upright to 1/2" for clearance to insert bolts. The REV 90 Degree Gearbox Side Plate and the Thrifty Bearing Megaplate can be removed and used to assemble the gearbox shortly. The opposite Bearing Megaplate can be left on if desired.

Take the two 02_Superstructure_Support and drill out similar mirrored clearance holes for bolts. Make sure the two 02_Superstructure_Support end up as correct mirrors of each other so that you end up with a left and right 02_Superstructure_Support. If you place the two 02_Superstructure_Supports down on a table next to each other with the angles forming a "V" as pictured, drilling out just the hole facing up on each 02_Superstructure_Support should give you a correctly mirrored pair.

Slide 02_Superstructure_Uprights into their position at the back of the chassis. The two inch face of each upright should be against the Chassis Outside Plate and the one inch face should be just forward of the upper flange of the Chassis End Plate by 1/8 of an inch. The bottom of the 02_Superstructure_Uprights should partially rest over the wider, lower flange of the Chassis End Plate.

The two holes in each 02_Superstructure_Upright should line up with the two holes in the Chassis Outside Plate shown.

Using two 1/4-20 1/2" bolts on each side, loosely bolt the 02_Superstructure_Uprights to the Chassis Outside Plate. Place a bolt on the end of a 3/8” allen wrench or T-handle and put it through the 1/2” clearance hole on the inside of 02_Superstructure_Upright and then through the holes in both the 02_Superstructure_Upright and the matching hole already in the Chassis Outside Plate. Affix it with a 1/4-20 locknut and repeat for the other holes in each 02_Superstructure_Upright. The matching holes in each Chassis Inside Plate can be useful for putting an allen wrench through when tightening these bolts.

Similarly, hold one of the 02_Superstructure_Support so that its angled edge meets up with 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. Loosely bolt it to the Chassis Outside Plate using a 1/4-20 1/2" bolt and nut in the same way as the 02_Superstructure_Upright above, making sure that the 02_Superstructure_Support can still rotate.

Push the front of the chassis against a wall or other vertical surface and make sure that the lowest corner of the 02_Superstructure_Top_Crossbeam is 2.5 inches away from the wall. Rotate the 02_Superstructure_Support around so that their angled tops meet up with 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. Clamp two 120 Degree Gussets to each 02_Superstructure_Support and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam so that when riveted the arm superstructure will be held in the correct place.

Drill out and rivet the gussets into place and tighten the six 1/4-20 bolts in the 02_Superstructure_Uprights and 02_Superstructure_Support.

Measure up from the bottom end of 02_Superstructure_Support and mount the bottom of 03_Arm_Cross 9.5" up. There will be two 90 degree gussets used on both the front and back of each side of this assembly for a total of eight 90 degree gussets. Clamp them on in pairs and then drill them out and rivet them using 3/16 rivets.

The battery bracket is installed in the rear of the robot and slightly off center. Looking at the rear Chassis End Plate from the behind the robot, the top plate of the Andymark battery bracket is installed with four empty holes in the flange of the Chassis End Plate to the left of the left tab of the battery bracket top plate and five open holes to the right of the right tab of the battery bracket top plate. Install the top plate using the included 10-32 hardware.

Because the Chassis End Plate is installed upside down from how it is intended to be used, the bottom plate of the battery bracket is installed backwards, with the two holes intended for mounting to the support churros instead mounting to the lower flange of the chassis. The four holes in the other end of the bracket can be screwed into the rear electronics board later for extra stability. Make sure to bolt on the included battery strap.

# MAX Planetary gearbox assembly

Tools required:

* 5/32" allen wrench

* 1/8" allen wrench

Parts required:

* Qty(1) x MAX Planetary Base Kit

    * Some components will remain unused

* Qty(1) x MAX Planetary 90 Degree Gearbox

* Qty(2) x MAX Planetary 5:1 Stage

* Qty(1) x MAX Planetary 3:1 Stage

* Qty(1) x NEO Motor

Begin by assembling the MAX Planetary 90 Degree Gearbox. Place the two Side Plates down so that the recessed counterbores around some of the mounting holes are on the bottom. Insert two of the flanged bearings so the flanges are on the flat side of the Side Plates.

Install the two Standoffs into the two holes closest to the angled corners in the flat side of one of the Side Plates with two 10-32 3/8" button head screws. Insert the Output Shaft into the bearing in the SIde Plate with Standoffs installed. The end of the Output Shaft with the short hexagonal section should be facing upwards and away from the Side Plate.

Take the Bottom Plate with raised corners facing up and insert one of the flanged bearings down into it. Press the Input Gear into the bearing so the slanted teeth are facing up.

Set down the Middle Plate so that the recessed counterbore for the bearing is facing up and insert the small bearing into the Middle Plate.

Pick up the Middle Plate with bearing and flip it over, interesting it down on top of the Input gear. The Middle Plate will float above the Bottom Plate.

Turn the assembly on its side and set it into the Side Plate so that the Middle Plate slots into the notches in the Side Plate and the edge of the Bottom Plate sits flush with the Side Plate.

Slide the Bevel Gear down onto the end of the Output Shaft so that its hexagonal center hole mates with the hexagonal section of the Output Shaft and the slanted teeth of the gear mate with the slanted teeth of the Input Gear.

Drop the second Side Plate and bearing down on top of the assembly so the recessed screw holes are facing upwards. Install four 10-32 3/8" button head screws in the recessed holes in the Side Plate and into both the Standoffs and the Bottom Plate. Leave these bolts slightly loose for now.

  

Flip the gearbox over and install the last two 10-32 3/8" button head screws through the Side Plate and into the Bottom Plate. Leave these screws slightly loose. Check that the gearbox spins smoothly by spinning it by hand and that all the plates are pressed flush against each other.

After checking that the gearbox spins smoothly, tighten all the 10-32 3/8" screws. Make sure the gearbox still turns smoothly. Insert the MAX Planetary Spline to 1/2” Hex Adaptor into the input of the 90 Degree Gearbox.

Take the MAX Planetary 3:1 Stage and line it up with the spline sticking out of the 90 Degree Gearbox. Rotate the gear cartridge until the two splines line up and mesh together. Continue rotating the cartridge until all the mounting and alignment features are engaged and the cartridge sits flush against the gearbox.

Take the two MAX Planetary 5:1 Stage cartridges and add them both to the stackup one at a time, making sure the splines and alignment features mesh together properly and there are no gaps in the stack.

Now prepare the NEO motor to be installed into the stackup. Place the MAX Planetary Universal Input Stage against the face of the NEO motor and align the two mounting holes with the mounting holes in the face of the NEO motor. Screw the NEO motor in place using two 10-32 1/2" socket cap bolts. Spin both bolts down into place and then alternate back and forth between the two bolts to evenly tighten them. 

Take the 2mm machine key in the MAX Planetary Input Coupler Kit and insert it into the keyway of the NEO motor as close to the face of the NEO motor as possible. Align the keyway in the Input Coupler with the machine key and slide it over the NEO’s output shaft and key.

Align the stacked gear stages with the Input Stage and the Input Coupler. You may have to rotate the bottom 5:1 gear cartridge to get the Input Coupler to mesh properly. Make sure there are no gaps between the Input Stage and the individual gear cartridges, rotating them slightly until their alignment features fall into place.

Bolt the stack together using two 10-32 3" Socket Head screws, the longest that come provided in the MAX Planetary Base Kit. The bolts are inserted into the holes next to the NEO motor in the Input Plate, through the gear cartridges, and into the 90 Degree Gearbox.

Fit a 1/2" hex bearing into one of the Thrifty Bearing Megaplates and position it on the rear left 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam so that the mounting holes around the bearing line up with the holes drilled in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. Line up the mounting holes in the output face of the MAX Planetary gearbox and bolt through the Thrifty Bearing Megaplate and 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and into the MAX Planetary gearbox with four 10-32 1-1/2 button head bolts. The two smaller number 8 sized holes in the Thrifty Bearing Megaplate should have already been drilled out to fit a 10-32 bolt with a #7 drill bit when the Bearing Megalate was used in constructing the 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam.

Similarly affix the other Thrifty Bearing Megaplate with smaller holes drilled out to the rear right 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam with four more 10-32 1-1/2 button head bolts and 10-32 locknuts on the other side. Insert a hex bearing from the outside, which will be held in by a washer and bolt later.

02_Superstructure_Jackshaft can be slid through the bearings and gearbox at this time. If your hex shaft is not easily going through the bearings and gearbox, the bolts holding them tight on the bar can be slightly loosened and retightened in a slightly different position in their hole or a rubber mallet can be used to knock 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft into place. There should be room for a 24 Tooth 1/2" Hex Sprocket on either end of the shaft. Use a 10-32 3/8” bolt and a washer to retain the 02_Superstructure_Jackshaft.

(ignore the extra bearing located on the inside face of the right 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam - this was a slightly earlier design)

The two Thrifty Clamping Bearing Blocks are installed around the upper 1.125" inch holes in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beams. Insert a flanged 1/2” hex bearing into each half so that the flange sits inside the ridge on the inside of each half. The bearing will stick out the front of the block - if it sticks out in the same direction as the mounting posts in the corners, flip it around.

The bearing blocks have a "top" and a “bottom.” If you place them down on a table you can see that there are two different orientations - the position on the left, with the longer section facing up, has the bearing hole lower down on the plate than with the short side up like on the right. The long side of the bearing block should face upward on 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam. This is why the upper bearing holes were slightly offset from center when drilling 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam earlier.

Hold each half of the bearing blocks against the upper bearing hole in 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam and use the provided bolts to hold the two halves together. Rivet the blocks in place in the hole pointing down 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam with a 3/16 rivet to prevent them from moving on the beam. Only rivet this hole, as any other rivets in this plate will rub against the chain later on.

Lastly, we will add some additional reinforcement to the top crossbeam using chassis cutoff. To manufacture this part cutoff the shorter piece of the "C". Then cut down the inner part of the C such that it fits onto the 1x1 02_Superstructure_Top_Crossbeam. The hole locations do not matter too much. Attached like shown in the photo below. Do this on both sides of the 02_Superstructure_Main_Beam.
